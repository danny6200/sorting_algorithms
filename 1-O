O(1)  - Best case: When the list is already sorted, and no swaps are needed.
O(n^2) - Average case: In the average case, Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements.
O(n^2) - Worst case: When the list is sorted in reverse order, and each element needs to be moved to the correct position.
